	{\normalsize\emph{I'm a Data \& Automation Specialist at Corley, an AWS Advanced Partner.
	And when I can, I'm a mentor for a local Coderdojo and AWS \& PyData evangelist.
	I wrote my first code in GWbasic on T1000 with MS-DOS 2.11, when I was eight years old. And I dissected an animal a lot of time before..
	I have a Bsc in biological science, physiopathological area and a PhD in biotechnology, bioinformatics area.
	I love the technical approach and learn new languages and storage services. I'm curious, sensible and precise.
	I play without breaks when I can develop or automate applications by extreme programming, dataops, devops, mlops and applying the standards.
	Studying, playing, learning and sharing are my legs. Where I'll go, it depends only from the next challenge you will throw me.
